About distribution-manager:
- Collect package information from __setup__(__plugin__)/__init__.py files in each package.
- Generate eggs to path
- Generate setup.py and setup.cfg files used for pypi upload
- Publish package to pypi (requires auth)

!!!IMPORTANT!!!
Only use this if your intention is to publish NEW components/plugins versions to pypi.

Usage (Ubuntu):
1. create in your home directory pypi config file:

echo "[distutils]
index-servers =
    pypi

[pypi]
username:Sourcefabric
password:Sofabulous#78" > ~/.pypirc

2. Build and publish components and/or plugins:
(python 3.2.5 is required, for now)

python3 distribution.py --location [path] 
				        --location [path] --components 
				        --location [path] --plugins

Help: 
  path         - the path where the eggs will be deployed
  --components - build and publish only ally-py components
  --plugins    - build and publish only ally-py plugins 


For installing ally-py core with deps:

pip-3.2 install --target /opt/superdesk/ -r all.txt
